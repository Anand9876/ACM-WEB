  <h2>Petluri Sai Anand</h2>
  <p>

I am an enthusiastic and detail-oriented developer with a strong interest in web and app development, as well as data analysis. I have successfully completed a hands-on course where I gained practical experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Python equipping me with a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development.

My passion lies in creating intuitive, responsive digital experiences and leveraging data-driven insights to solve real-world problems. I enjoy turning complex challenges into clean, efficient solutions and continuously strive to improve my skills and stay updated with the latest technologies in the software and analytics space.

Whether itâ€™s building user-friendly interfaces or analyzing data to uncover trends, I bring a strong work ethic, a collaborative mindset, and a desire to keep learning.
