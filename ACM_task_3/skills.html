    <h2>What I've done?</h2>
  <p>

I’m a passionate and self-driven developer with hands-on experience in game development, front-end web and mobile development, and data analysis. My journey began with creating simple yet engaging games using JavaScript and the p5.js editor, where I built projects like a T-Rex Runner clone, Ping Pong, and other interactive games.

As my interest deepened, I explored physics-based simulations using the Matter.js physics engine, through which I successfully built a working Angry Birds clone, gaining strong insights into object interactions, forces, and real-time rendering.

Alongside game development, I expanded my skills in front-end frameworks. I’ve built responsive user interfaces using React.js and developed cross-platform mobile components with React Native. I also learned to structure and transport data using XML (Extensible Markup Language) to support communication between components and systems.

More recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in data analysis. Using Python, I’ve learned to process, analyze, and extract insights from data  a skill I aim to integrate into my future projects for building smarter, data-driven applications.

I'm continuously exploring new technologies and enjoy solving problems through both creativity and logic — whether it's building interactive experiences or turning raw data into meaningful results.
