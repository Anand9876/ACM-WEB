Flexbox Froggy Challenge – All 24 Levels Conquered!
Welcome to my Flexbox Froggy Challenge repository! This project chronicles my complete journey through all 24 levels of the captivating game, Flexbox Froggy. It's an interactive and highly effective way to master core CSS Flexbox concepts in a fun, visual environment.
📚 About This Project
Flexbox Froggy is an engaging learning game where you guide charming frogs to their lily pads by applying various CSS Flexbox properties. You tackle increasingly complex challenges using real Flexbox code such as:
 * display: flex
 * justify-content
 * align-items
 * flex-direction
 * ...and many more!
I've meticulously documented my solutions and progress, including screenshots for every single level, all neatly organized within the Flexbox-Froggy/ directory.
✅ My Completion Process
Here's how I navigated through every Flexbox Froggy challenge:
 * 🎮 Interactive Solving: I tackled each level directly on the Flexbox Froggy platform.
 * ✍️ CSS Coding: For every challenge, I wrote the precise CSS Flexbox code to achieve the desired layout.
 * 📸 Solution Captures: After successfully completing each level, I took a screenshot, ensuring both the visual outcome and my CSS solution were visible.
 * 📁 Organized Documentation: Each image is saved and named intuitively as level-<number>.png (e.g., level-1.png) inside the dedicated Flexbox-Froggy/ folder.
 * 📖 Reference When Needed: I utilized helpful documentation like W3Schools whenever a deeper understanding of a Flexbox property was required.
🛠️ Key Resources
 * 📘 W3Schools Flexbox Guide: This was my invaluable go-to reference for comprehensive understanding of Flexbox properties and their behaviors.
📝 Important Notes
Every screenshot you'll find in the Flexbox-Froggy/ folder clearly captures two essential elements:
 * ✅ The visual outcome of the level (the frogs perfectly positioned on their lily pads).
 * 💻 The exact CSS code I wrote to solve that specific puzzle.
Thanks for hopping by and checking out my complete Flexbox journey! 🌱🐸
